                    <h2 class="display-4">Problem Statement:</h2>
                            <p>First-time solo female travelers feel overwhelmed by the planning process, have to deal with anxiety, and are concerned about safety.</p>                          
                    <h2 class="display-4">User Interviews:</h2>
                    <p>I conducted some user interviews and surveys from a wide range of demographics. Women around the age group 25–40 years are very much interested in trying solo traveling but never had the courage to try one. For some, it is just a dream as they worry about safety in new places.
                    </br></br>Many women have a desire to try solo traveling to their favorite destinations. Some shared their concerns like ‘I get nervous going to a place that I’ve never been to. I am very young and feel like I will be kidnapped or so..’.
                       </br></br>Another pain point the user shared was about planning. ‘I don’t like to do all the planning and packing on my own. But when I had to go alone once, I did really enjoy that moment. If I have some help in planning or research and suggest places to visit, stay, and for good food, I would really do more solo traveling.’</br></br>
                       <h2 class="display-4">Affinity Diagram:</h2>
                       <p>Based on 5 interviews and Google form surveys, I created an affinity diagram with all the valuable inputs from users. There are some repeated experiences shared which are combined and put under specific categories.

                            <p>There are many resources available for female travelers. Some of the key points were taken and were put in a SWOT analysis. Many young women who want to try it for the first time are reluctant as the existing app targets information for more experienced female travelers and also to far away destinations.</p>

                <p>I have learned a lot from user testing, and there is always some valuable feedback that will refine the app.</br>
                    Planning and organizing the ideas, analyzing user insights, and always connecting back to the problem statement helped me in the design process.</br>
                    There is always more room for learning. The next step would be to add a feedback feature in the app to get any ideas, improvements, ratings, or issues users have.</br></br></p>
