                <p>The current website, as is, consists of many problems ranging from design, user interface, usability,
                    and functionality. The concept is solid, but through user testing, and our own assessments, the
                    website in its current form is borderline broken webpage to the users.</p>
                <h2 class="display-4">Project Goals:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Enhance User Experience: </b>The current website, as is, consists of many problems ranging from design, user interface,
                        usability, and functionality. The concept is solid, but through user testing, and our own assessments, the

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Increase User Engagement: </b>Increase user engagement by providing valuable content, such as articles, guides, and resources related to nonprofit job searching and career development.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Expand Job Listings: </b>Increase the number of job listings on the website by attracting more charities and organizations to post their job openings.

                <h2 class="display-4">User Interviews:</h2>
                <p>We conducted some user interviews with the existing website. The website has many issues like some
                    links leading to the 401 page not found error page. The UI design was not pleasing as it had very
                    bright red colors which users complained of as symbolizing a danger sign. The navigation was not
                    user-friendly to get the information they wanted. Some navigation leads to a broken webpage. The
                    heuristic checklist was created to list down all evaluate the current state of the website and what
                    were the challenges and issues that need to be focused.</p>
                <p>Based on 5 interviews and Google form surveys, I created an affinity diagram with all the valuable
                    inputs from users. There are some repeated experiences shared which are combined and put under
                    specific categories.

                <h2 class="display-4">Affinity Diagram:</h2>
                <p>An affinity diagram was used to bring all the challenges, suggestions, and feedback received from the
                    user interviews conducted. It was categorized and analyzed based on the different scopes.</p>

                            experiences from others. Considering the employers for all the job listings with any current

                        were changed, and easy to navigate. Different tabs for Jobs and Volunteer opportunities were
                        listed and filter options to get specific job/volunteer descriptions. Resumes can be uploaded
                        and sent to the employers from the website with a confirmation email sent.</p>

        <p>I have learned a lot from user testing, and there is always some valuable feedback that will refine the
            app.</br>
            Planning and organizing the ideas, analyzing user insights, and always connecting back to the problem
            statement helped me in the design process.</br>
            There is always more room for learning. The next step would be to add a feedback feature in the app to
            get any ideas, improvements, ratings, or issues users have.</br></br></p>
